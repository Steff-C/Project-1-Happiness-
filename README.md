# Project-1-Happiness-
Team 5 Project 1 

1.  The jupyter notebook Presentation Happiness vs Alcohol Consumption is the file used for presentation. This doen't include all of the code we used in the analysis.

2.  The jupyter notebook Happiness is where all of our work was completed.  It houses all of the code, with the exception of the heatmap.

3.  The jupyter notebook Happiness vs Alcohol Heatmaps is where we completed work to make a heatmap.

A few things to note:
- The image appendix in our presentation file is a library of all of the charts we compiled in our analysis.  
- The project proposal file includes our source links and infomation.
